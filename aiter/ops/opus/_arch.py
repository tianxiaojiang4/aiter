"""Reusable GPU architecture probe for opus subpackages.

opus subpackages (a16w16, future a8w8, ...) need to know whether the
current GPU is one they support, so they can either expose the real
implementation or fall back to a stub that raises a clear error at
*invocation* time (vs. at import time, which would break callers'
``from aiter import ...`` because :mod:`aiter.__init__` imports opus
inside a try/except that swallows ImportError and stops loading the
following 30+ unrelated ops).

The split between :func:`_detect_arch` (never raises) and
:func:`_check_arch` (raises) lets each caller pick its preferred
failure mode:

* ``__init__`` of an opus subpackage uses :func:`_detect_arch` so that
  importing it on a non-supported GPU is silent (warning + stub) and
  does not cascade into the surrounding ``aiter/__init__.py``.
* Anyone who *wants* a hard ImportError on the wrong arch (e.g. an
  external script that should refuse to start) can call
  :func:`_check_arch` directly.

Detection order (shared by both helpers):

1. ``GPU_ARCHS`` env var (split on ``';'``). Skips the special
   ``'native'`` token. This path covers build-only hosts (no GPU) and
   CI workflows that pin GPU_ARCHS explicitly.
2. ``GPU_ARCHS=native`` (default) -> probe ``rocminfo`` via
   ``aiter.jit.utils.chip_info.get_gfx_runtime``.
3. ``rocminfo`` unavailable (no GPU / CPU host) -> log debug and treat
   as "unknown"; the host-side dispatcher in ``opus_gemm.cu`` catches
   the unsupported device at call time.
